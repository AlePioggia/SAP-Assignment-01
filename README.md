#### Software Architecture and Platforms - a.y. 2024-2025
 
# Assignment #01 - 20241004 


- **Description:** Consider the "EBike application" demo included in this repo. Currently it is implemented as a BBoM, without following any specific software architecture. We want to: 

   - Create a new "EBike application" prototype, based on a layered software architecture. The prototype should allow remote users and administrators to interact with the system, and should upport some level of data persistency. 
   - Identify a number of core quality attributes to drive the design of the architecture and formalise them by means of proper quality attribute scenarios.
   - Identify a set of fitness functions useful to assess the structural properties of the architecture, to be checked using the proper tools (e.g. ArchUnit).    
   - Write a brief report including the description of the architecture structure using C&C view(s), the description of the quality attribute scenarios and of the fiftness functions, and the result of some  validation carried on the system.
    
- **Deliverable**:  a zipped folder ``Assignment-01-<Surname>`` including a maven-based or gradle-based project, with sources and the report in PDF. The deliverable can be submitted using a link on the course web site.

- **Deadline:** October 18, 2024 - 9:00 AM
